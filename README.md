# SmallBuild-Hypervisor-Customization
The main aim of this project is to study the small build hypervisors and test them on different working environments. The focus will be on the testing of different hypervisors on different operating systems. Some hypervisors only work on windows environment and some are kernel based virtual machines. So the project focuses on the use of these hypervisors on different distributions and subsequently notes their reactions. K-Hypervisor is an Open Source light-weighted Nested-Virtual Machine Monitor in Windows x64 platform, which has been derived from other virtual platforms like DdiMon, which is a hypervisor performing inline hooking that is invisible to a guest.
